## Pathfinding algorithms: BFS, Djikstra's, A*
Variations were used in many of the puzzles. I used a flood fill BFS for part 2 of Day18, A* for days 12 and 24. BFS for Day 16 for graph traversal.

## Floyd's Tortoise and Hare
Cycle detection for Day 17

## Optimization
Many of the last half of the puzzles required optimization. Even if you have an algorithm that works, you need to cut down the data set you're applying it to and eliminate redundant work. Especially prevalent in days 14, 16, 17, 19, and 24.


## Thoughts
Overall, it was really fun. It's been a while since I took a data structures and algorithms class, so it was invigorating to be reintroduced to some of the concepts.
