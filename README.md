# AdventOfCode2022
Repository for advent of code code to find solutions. This year in Go.

## Thoughts
I still need to go back through and refactor my solutions, but they're working. Overall, it was really fun. It's been a while since I took a data structures and algorithms class, so it was invigorating to be reintroduced to some of the concepts.
  
  
Learning Go was fairly simple. I'd say a lot of its elegance comes from its simplicity. I don't know if I mastered 'idomatic' Go, but it felt natural overall and I could see myself using it again in the future.
